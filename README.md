# TicTacToe
This is a TicTacToe program I made in 2019.  It uses a minimax algorithm and offers single player and two player.

This is the main menu of the program where users can choose from 4 different options.  The screen instructs the user on their choices.

# Name Change Menu

Option 'b' in the menu will lead to here, it will allow the first player who enters their name to choose between 'X's and 'O's, and the second player simply enters
their name.  These names will be used for display purposes.

# Two Player Mode

Option 'c' in the menu will lead to a Two-player mode.  It will state who's turn it is, and they will prompted to enter the grid space to
place their marker.

Here is an example of player one "Mark" entering in their coordinate for their play.

Here is an example of a cat scratch, the players are then prompted to either play again, or to go back to the menu by typing either option.

Option 'd' will pit the player against the minimax ai, basically dooming the player to either lose or cat scratch with the "Mr. X" ai I've made. Here is an example
of me losing to the ai, it shows the win screen for if the player with 'O's won the game.

That is the extent of the program, it consists of one header and the rest are cpp files that need to be build together.  Observation of a
working minimax algorithm can also be found in this program.
